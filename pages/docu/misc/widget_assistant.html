	<h1>Widget Assistant</h1>

	<div class="docu">

		<h2>Activating the Assistant</h2>

		Go to the configuration page and activate the widget assistant in the "options" section. After saving the settings, the widget 
		assistant will show up in the system menu on the left. We recommend to de-activate it in stable productive environments since 
		its libraries consume significant ressources and extend loading time. 
		<br />
		
		<h2>Using the Assistant</h2>

		Select Widget Assistant from the menu and start typing a widget name into the white editor window. Autocomplete select lists will appear where you can select your widget.
		As soon as you have entered a widget name and clicked inside the parentheses, a tooltip window opens and gives you instructions for 
		each parameter.
		<br />
		<div class="html">
			<img src="lib/widget_assistant/WA_Screenshot.png" style="padding:1%; width:96%;"> </img>
		</div>

		<h2>Result</h2>

		After Editing the widget press "Preview Widget & copy final Widget to Clipboard".
		A new window opens displaying the visu element defined by the widget. It can be tested in live mode like a normal visu page. <br>
		The code is already available on the clipboard and can be pasted into a html page you want to medit.
